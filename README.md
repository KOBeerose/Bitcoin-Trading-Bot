# Bitcoin-Trading-Bot
The goal of this project is to create a trading bot in python.

Data to use: Bitcoin

This data must be divided into two parts: a part for training the model used in trading (for example a history of data from the year 2020). A second part for the validation (backtesting) of the model (2021 data for example).

The ultimate goal is to achieve maximum gain over a given period (year 2021 for example).
